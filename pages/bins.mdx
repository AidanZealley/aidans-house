# 🗑 Waste Disposal

## What goes in

⚫️ Black: **General Waste**

🟢 Green: **Mixed Recycling**

🟤 Brown: **Garden Waste**

## When they go out

⚫️ Black / 🟢 Green: **Tuesday**

🟤 Brown: **Thursday** (I think. I always forget and at this point I'm scared to open it.)

For black/green the one to put out will be the one at the front. After collection swap them over so the next one is at the front.

  Aim to put the bin out earlier than anyone else on the street to establish
  dominance. Even put the bin out a full 24 hours early in order to secure alpha
  status.
