## 🍽 Dishwasher

You're probably looking forward to the luxury of effortless dishwashing, just load her up and let her eat!
Unfortunately the dishwasher at Aidan's House is a bit shagged. You'll hit start after meticulously loading it according to the strict [loading instructions](/kitchen#loading-instructions) and get on with your day, only to return and find it sat there blinking a red light.

I've not actually looked up what the red light means but it's probably something along the lines of "Flashy flashy no washy washy".
The solution is (you've guessed it) to turn it off and on again then hit start again.
Unfortunately you generally have to do this multiple times over a period of a couple of hours before it finally begins a wash.
Fortunately the off, on, start button pressing procedure produces a catchy tune.

Sometimes it stops mid-wash with a green and red light on. If this happens just play the tune again.

Just kidding 😂

## 🫧 Sodastream

If the soda stream runs out of gas it's in the cupboard on your left as you walk into the kitchen, right next to the [Wet Food](/cats#wet-food)

<Callout emoji="🥛">
  Sodastreaming of certain liquids, for example milk, is not advisable.
