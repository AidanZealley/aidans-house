## üçΩ Dishwasher

You're probably looking forward to the luxury of effortless dishwashing, just load her up and let her eat!
Unfortunately the dishwasher at Aidan's House is a bit shagged. You'll hit start after meticulously loading it according to the strict [loading instructions](/kitchen#loading-instructions) and get on with your day, only to return and find it sat there blinking a red light.

I've not actually looked up what the red light means but it's probably something along the lines of "Flashy flashy no washy washy".
The solution is (you've guessed it) to turn it off and on again then hit start again.
Unfortunately you generally have to do this multiple times over a period of a couple of hours before it finally begins a wash.
Fortunately the off, on, start button pressing procedure produces a catchy tune.

Sometimes it stops mid-wash with a green and red light on. If this happens just play the tune again.

Oh and one compartment of the cutlery basket has a hole in so stuff falls straight through. Not telling you which compartment though, it's a surprise.

Just kidding üòÇ

## üß¶ Washing Machine

Liquids for the washing machine are in the cupboard next to it. I'm not convinced it matters which compartment of the tray you put the liquids in so any hole's a goal.

### Settings

**Number 13** - This is your go-to setting, your daily driver. No other dials affect it. You just put your clothes in, hit start and after 35mins they come out clean, hot and mildly moist.

**Number 3** - This is a bit like Number 13 but a longer, deeper clean. This is your go-to for heavily soiled sheets.

**Rinse** - Flick the dial one up from 13. A rather misleading name as it does do a proper wash if you put liquid in, this is for your delicates because you can turn the drying off.

## üóë General Waste

The bin for general waste is in the cupboard to the left of the oven.

Bags for the bin are in the draw next to the kettle.

## ‚ôªÔ∏è Recycling

The mixed recycling bag is in the cupboard with the bin.

As for what goes in the recycling bin you can consult the chart stuck to the side of the fridge or go with what your heart tells you is correct (probably incorrect).

## ü´ß Sodastream

If the soda stream runs out of gas it's in the cupboard on your left as you walk into the kitchen, right next to the [Wet Food](/cats#wet-food)

<Callout emoji="ü•õ">
  Sodastreaming of certain liquids, for example milk, is not advisable.
