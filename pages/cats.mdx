# Cats

Arguably the biggest threat to surviving at Aidan's House are the cats. **Moose**, **Beans** and **Dill** (optionally **Bill**).
Their single minded determination to create mess will challenge your patience to its limits.

## üçü Food

### Dry Food

  Dry food lives in the cupboard in the conservatory.

Feeding generally just consists of keeping the dry food topped up.
They're posh cunts now so they get expensive dry food. However, I'm not a posh cunt, so I mix it down 50:50 with peasant food.
Split a scoop or two of peasant food between the bowls then sprinkle with the posh stuff. Salt Bae style is optional when sprinkling.
If there's still lots of food in the bowls just leave it until they eat it, the ungrateful cunts.

Top up at the following times:

#### üåÖ Morning

No particular time, just whenever you get up

#### üåÑ Afternoon

After work, 5pm or when you get sick of them meowing, whichever comes first.

#### üåå Evening

No particular time, just whenever you want to sleep. For more information, see [Bed Time](/cats#-bed-time)

### Wet Food

In an attempt to increase variety in their diet and prolong ~my torment~ their lives they now also get posh wet food.
As previously mentioned I'm not a posh cunt so they only get one tray per day, split between them.
The procedure is as follows:

1. Shut yourself in the Kitchen.
2. Get the bowls out (Dill will start meowing now).
3. Use a utensil of your choice to split a tray into the 3 bowls and smush it (Dill might be trying to batter down the door now).
4. Put one of the bowls down on the kitchen floor.
5. Open the kitchen door for Dill to charge in absolutely frothing at the mouth.
6. Take the other two bowls into the conservatory and shut Moose and Beans in with them to prevent Dill eating their food too.
7. Rinse the bowls and leave them on the side for tomorrow morning.

  Access to human food is strongly discouraged due to potential gastric
  disasters of the Moose variety. Test at your peril!

## üíß Water

Water is provided in the following locations:

- Big ass bowl in the conservatory.
- Posh ass fountain in the office.

### Big Ass bowl

A quick rinse and re-fill in the kitchen sink each morning. If there's algae growing in it, give it a quick wash.

### Posh Ass fountain

You can leave this turned on all the time, they usually drink it all in a couple of days.
To refill it:

1. Unplug it.
2. Take it to the bathroom.
3. Fill it from the bath tap.

## üöΩ Litter Tray

Everyone's favourite job!

If you're lucky the cats will have been keeping their toilet activities within the confines of one of the two litter trays all day (lol not a chance).

Scoop the contents into one of the green bags in the drawer next to the kettle every morning, or more often if you're treated to a particularly delicious scent during the day.

Put the green goodybag in the black bin outside.

## üí© Unexpected Messes

Potential unexpected messes include (but are not limited to):

- Being sick on the wooden floor downstairs (ideal case).
- Being sick on the carpet upstairs or on the rug (slightly less than ideal case).
- Being sick down the inside of a radiator (very not ideal case).
- Spotting a nugget of poo that has been dropped outside of the litter tray.
- A nugget of poo which didn't drop and was instead dragged across the carpet instead.
- Not spotting a nugget of poo that has been dropped outside of the litter tray and stepping in it.

Luckily there is a global solution for all of the above, **The Mighty Yellow Cloth** and its sidekick **All Purpose Cleaner Spray**.

For sick it's best to get the majority of it soaked up with tissue first to prevent clogging of **The Mighty Yellow Cloth**.

After an event, stick **The Mighty Yellow Cloth** in the wash so it's ready for the next one.

## üõå Bed Time

When you want to go to sleep it's a good idea to put them in the conservatory. This is for your own physical and mental health.

If you opt not to do this they **will** batter the bedroom door down and they **will** sleep on the bed where they want, which is invariably somewhere awkward.

Now iss a good time to top up the dry food if it's looking bare.

## üí° Tips & Tricks

### Doors

Keeping doors shut will become second nature pretty quickly. Doors of particular note are:

- Spare Bedroom: They'll get under the bed and getting them out can be near impossible.
- Office: Around bed time you may want to shut this to prevent them hiding inside the sofa.
- Kitchen: They'll open every cupboard and rip the bin apart.

### Getting them into bed

Moose is usually the one that tries to hide at bed time. If you grab him the others should follow.
